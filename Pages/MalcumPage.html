                     Loki Being Loki

                <div class="box">Loki Being Loki was one of my first VFX projects, born out of my admiration for the Marvel TV show. Drawing inspiration from the rich visual and narrative world of 'Loki,' I set out to reimagine the character in a way that allowed me to explore my creativity while honing my VFX skills. The project was a blend of imaginative storytelling and technical experimentation, combining visual effects to elevate the character's essence and connect it to both the show and my personal creative interests. It was a fun and rewarding experience that pushed the boundaries of my abilities and passion for VFX.
