          <div class="box_1">I have been passionate about creativity and innovation since the age of 12. With a deep desire to become the person who can make anything, I have always gravitated toward video and media as powerful outlets for expression. This lifelong passion has driven me to explore and master various creative disciplines, culminating in their discovery of VFX as the ultimate tool for bringing ideas to life. Through visual effects, I have truly unleashed their capabilities, using cutting-edge techniques to tell compelling stories and push the boundaries of media production.

          <div class="box_2">I utilize a versatile toolkit to bring creative ideas to life. For simple video editing, they rely on Premiere Pro, crafting seamless narratives with precision. To add dynamic effects and assets that elevate their projects, After Effects becomes their go-to tool for motion graphics and visual storytelling. For 3D animation and control, Blender provides the power and flexibility to create immersive and detailed scenes. Finally, Photoshop serves as the perfect companion for editing static photos and refining visual elements that seamlessly integrate into their videos. Together, these tools enable me to turn imagination into reality.
